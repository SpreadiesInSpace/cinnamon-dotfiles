# /etc/slackpkg/blacklist
#
# This is a blacklist file. Any packages listed here won't be
# upgraded, removed, or installed by slackpkg.

# aaa_libraries should NOT be blacklisted!
#
# You can blacklist using regular expressions.
#
# All of the following will be checked for the regex: 
# Package series, name, version, arch, build, and fullname
# When blacklisting packages, you can use extended regex on package names
# (such as xorg-.* instead of xorg-server, xorg-docs, etc), and a trailing 
# slash for package series ("n/", "ap/", "xap/", etc).
#
# To blacklist *only* the "xorg-server" package, use this:
# xorg-server
#
# To blacklist *all* of the "xorg-server-*" packages, use this:
# xorg-server.*
#
# To blacklist the entire KDE package set, use this:
# kde/
#
# You will need to escape any special characters that are present in the
# package name. For example, to blacklist the gcc-g++ package, use this:
# gcc-g\+\+
#
# DON'T put any space(s) before or after the package name or regex.
#
# Automated upgrade of kernel packages may not be wanted in some situations;
# uncomment the lines below if that fits your circumstances, but note that
# kernel-headers should *not* be blacklisted:
#
#kernel-generic.*
#kernel-huge.*
#kernel-modules.*
#kernel-source
