# For configuration options that have only two states, possible values are
# either "on" or "off"

# Remember, the only official Slackware ports are x86, s390, arm, and aarch64,
# and slackpkg developers don't have s390 boxes for testing.  If you are 
# testing/using other architectures and have suggestions or patches, please 
# let us know (email rworkman@slackware.com)
#
# Select the architecture of your system. Valid values are: 
#	i#86 (where # is 3, 4, 5 or 6)
#	x86_64
#	s390
#	arm* (* can be v4, v5tejl, and other ARM versions) 
#	aarch64
#	powerpc
#
# The line is commented because slackpkg will try to find your 
# architecture automagically.  If you want to override what slackpkg
# finds, put the value after the = and uncomment this line
#ARCH=

# The default PKGMAIN is "slackware", but some derived distros use other
# names as the main directory.  PKGMAIN is the place with the slackware
# package series (a, ap, n, ... ).
#
# Usually slackpkg can automagically discover this variable.  If you want
# to override the discovered variable, then uncomment this line and change
# it to reflect the correct value of PKGMAIN
#PKGMAIN=slackware

# Slackware packages are signed by project key.  Slackpkg uses this key
# to check if the packages downloaded are valid, so remember to set 
# CHECKGPG to "on". 
# 
# Usually slackpkg can automagically discover this variable. If you want
# to override the discovered variable, then uncomment this line and edit
# as needed
#SLACKKEY="Slackware Linux Project <security@slackware.com>"

# Downloaded files will be in the TEMP directory:
TEMP=/var/cache/packages

# Package lists, file lists, and others will be stored in WORKDIR:
WORKDIR=/var/lib/slackpkg

# Special options for wget (default is WGETFLAGS="--passive-ftp")
WGETFLAGS="--passive-ftp"

# If DELALL is "on", all downloaded files will be removed after install.
DELALL=on

# If CHECKMD5 is "on", the system will check the md5sums of all packages before
# install/upgrade/reinstall is performed.
CHECKMD5=on

# If CHECKGPG is "on", the system will verify the GPG signature of each package
# before install/upgrade/reinstall is performed.
CHECKGPG=on

# If CHECKSIZE is "on", the system will check if we have sufficient disk
# space to install selected package. This make upgrade/install safer, but 
# will also slow down the upgrade/install process.
CHECKSIZE=off

# PRIORITY sets the download priority. slackpkg will try to found the
# package first in the first value, then the second one, through all
# values in list.
# 
# Default value: patches %PKGMAIN extra pasture testing
PRIORITY=( patches %PKGMAIN extra pasture testing )

# Enables (on) or disables (off) slackpkg's post-installation features, such
# as checking for new (*.new) configuration files and new kernel images, and
# prompts you for what it should do.  Default=on
POSTINST=on

# Post-installation features, by default, search all of /etc and a few other
# predefined locations for .new files.  This is the safe option: with it, 
# you won't have any unmerged .new files to cause problems.  Even so, some 
# people prefer that only the .new files installed by the current slackpkg 
# session be checked.  If this is your case, change ONLY_NEW_DOTNEW to "on".
# Default=off
ONLY_NEW_DOTNEW=off

# Whether to backup files overwritten by their .new counterparts with a
# .orig extension.
ORIG_BACKUPS=on

# The ONOFF variable sets the initial behavior of the dialog interface.
# If you set this to "on" then all packages will be selected by default.
# If you prefer the opposite option (all unchecked), then set this to "off".
ONOFF=on

# If this variable is set to "on", all files will be downloaded before the
# requested operation (install or upgrade) is performed.   If set to "off",
# then the files will be downloaded and the operation (install/upgrade)
# performed one by one.  Default=on
DOWNLOAD_ALL=on

# Enables (on) or disables (off) the dialog interface in slackpkg.  Default=on
DIALOG=on

# Enables (on) or disables (off) the non-interactive mode.  If set to "on",
# slackpkg will run without asking the user anything, and answer all questions
# with DEFAULT_ANSWER.  If you do any upgrades using this mode, you'll need to
# run "slackpkg new-config" later to find and merge any .new files.
BATCH=off

# Default answer to slackpkg questions. Can be "y" or "n".
DEFAULT_ANSWER=n

# Slackpkg allows a template to "include" the packages specified in another
# template.  This option enables (on) or disables (off) the parsing of
# any "#include" directives in template files.  Default=on
USE_INCLUDES=on

# Enables a spinning bar as visual feedback when slackpkg is making its
# internal lists and some other operations.  Default=on
SPINNING=on

# Max number of characters that "dialog" command can handle.
# If unset, this variable will be 19500 (the number that works on
# Slackware 10.2)
DIALOG_MAXARGS=139000

#
# The MIRROR is set from /etc/slackpkg/mirrors
# You only need to uncomment the selected mirror. 
# Uncomment one mirror only.
