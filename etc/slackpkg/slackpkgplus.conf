# By default slackpkg+ deny to install 32bit packages.
#
# Set this flag to 'on' allow slackpkg+ to install 32bit packages on a 64bit slackware
# installation (possibly unsafe). Please, do not install both 32 and 64bit of the same

# Do not forget to install the multilibs.
ALLOW32BIT=off

# Enable (on) / Disable (off) the official slackpkg blacklist. May be useful to temporarily skip
# the slackware blacklist. You can also override it from command line:
# 'USEBL=off slackpkg upgrade-all'
USEBL=on

# Enable (on) / Disable (off) the legacy blacklist system ignoring the improvement
# from slackpkg 15. Some improvement are not useful with third party repositories
# Note that the legacy system does apply it as regex to the entire pkglist row
# repository, name, version, arch, build, fullname, series/path, extension.
LEGACYBL=off

# Add custom option to 'wget'.
# You can solve the repository unavailability problems by set a timeout here
# Also add "-q" for super terse output (useful with USETERSE=on)

# process by downloading just new files (see README). Disabled by default (off)
CACHEUPDATE=off

# You can download-only by setting DOWNLOADONLY to 'on'. You may (you should) also use it in command line,
# for example: "DOWNLOADONLY=on slackpkg upgrade-all". Useful for large upgrades.
# You may also use 'slackpkg download' if you want to download few packages
#DOWNLOADONLY=off

# Enable (on) / Disable (off) notification events (see notifymsg.conf)

# Enable (on) / Disable (off) a Strict GPG Check. A repository should contains packages signed
# with the only original GPG-KEY. In some custom repository may be wanted to mix heterogeneous
# packages; to use that repository set Strict GPG Check to off. P.S: a repository can
# contain just ONE gpg-key; you may manually import the other.
STRICTGPG=on

# If two or more repositories contains some same packages, you can specify
# from which repository you prefer to search it.
# The syntax is "<repository_name>:<package_name>"
# Accepts regular expressions. To give priority to an entire repository use "<repository_name>"

# Examples:
#PKGS_PRIORITY=( restricted:vlc )
# OR
PKGS_PRIORITY=( csb )
#
# if you have two repositories to give priority you must set both in the same line
#PKGS_PRIORITY=( myrepo restricted:vlc )
#
#
# If you want a multilib system, uncomment the 'multilib' repository and set:
#PKGS_PRIORITY=( multilib )
#
# (Use /usr/doc/slackpkg+-*/setupmultilib.sh to setup a multilib configuration)

# Otherwise you can try to upgrade a package from a repository that contains a package with the
# same tag of the already installed package. Typically that means to upgrade a package from the
# same author of the already installed package.
# Note that this method may not works properly where two repositories contains a package with the
# same tag.
# Set TAG_PRIORITY to 'on' to enable this function
TAG_PRIORITY=on

# List repositories you want to use (defined below)
# remember to launch 'slackpkg update' if you modify this row.
REPOPLUS=( slackpkgplus csb )


# Define mirrors (uncomment one or more mirror; remember to add it to REPOPLUS)
# GPG Note: after adding/renaming a repository, you must to run 'slackpkg update gpg';
#           some repositories as salixos, have a partial GPG support;
#           for that repositories you may need to run slackpkg with 'slackpkg -checkgpg=off ...'
